***
Grbl-Advanced is a no-compromise, high performance, low cost alternative for CNC milling. This version of Grbl-Advanced runs on a STM32F411 Nucleo Board.

It accepts standards-compliant g-code and has been tested with the output of several CAM tools with no problems. Arcs, circles and helical motion are fully supported, as well as, all other primary g-code commands. Macro functions, variables, and most canned cycles are not supported, but we think GUIs can do a much better job at translating them into straight g-code anyhow.

Grbl-Advanced includes full acceleration management with look ahead. That means the controller will look up to 16 motions into the future and plan its velocities ahead to deliver smooth acceleration and jerk-free cornering.

* Built on the wonderful Grbl v1.1 (2017) firmware written by Sungeun "Sonny" Jeon, Ph.D. (USA).

### Extras:
#### Backlash Compensation:
Backlash compensation enabled by default. You can switch it off in Config.h.
Edit defaults.h to your needs.

* $140=(X Backlash [mm])
* $141=(Y Backlash [mm])
* $142=(Z Backlash [mm])

#### Canned Drill Cycles (G81-G83):
Added Canned Drill Cycles G81-G83 as additional features. 

#### 5-Axis support
Added experimental support for rotary axis (5-axis). They are roughly tested amd may contain still errors. Use at own risk!

#### Hard Reset
0x19 (CTRL-Y): Perform a hard reset.

#### Tool change
* $14=(tool change mode): 0 = Ignore M6; 1 = Manual Tool Change; 2 = Manual Tool Change + TLS
* $P: Save TLS position
* $T: Confirm tool change

Uses Dynamic TLO when $14=2

#### I2C EEPROM
Added support for external EEPROM (e.g. ST M24C08). Uncomment 'USE_EXT_EEPROM' in Config.h.

#### ETHERNET Support
GRBL-Advanced can be controlled with USB or ETHERNET. For ETHERNET an additional W5500 Module is required. Then uncomment ETH_IF in Platform.h. The default IP Address is 192.168.1.20.
Use [Candle 2](https://github.com/Schildkroet/Candle2) as control interface.

#### Attention
By default, settings are stored in internal flash memory in last sector. First startup takes about 5-10sec to write all settings.
